# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
Using EXCEL, I have analysied Bike sales for 1K users
For Europe, North America & Pacific region.

Dataset type- Excel data (XLSX)

Data cleaning:
1. Removed Duplicates
2. Formatting M/S (Martial Status) to Married & Singal for clear understanding
3. Same for gender- M/F -> Male/Female
4. Made sure all the values for Income are in Curancy format
5. Craeted Age Group for grouping the data and understanding the trend better.

Main objective:
Getting insights for Bike Buyers.
1. Age group: Most bike buyers are found to be in Middle Age category(30-50yrs)
2. Commute Distance is also playing a role while purchasing the bike. It is seen that for 0-1Miles we have highest rate of bike buyers and then declining after 5miles.
3. We can slice the data according to
   * Martial Status
   * Region
   * Education
to get more insights.
